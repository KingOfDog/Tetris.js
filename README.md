Although, he got inspiration by the puzzle game Pentomino To date, over 100 million copies were sold and there exist over 65 ports for different plattforms.
The game consists of seven different blocks called Tetrominos (I, J, L, O, S, T). The letters represent the forms of the Tetrominos, which all possess four squares as the building material.
